# Welcome dear recruiters üëã

Hi! My name is **≈Åukasz Jargie≈Ço** and I am a pharmacist by training.  I became interested in **Java programming** in 2022 and have since started exploring it on my own. A year and a half later, I left my frustrating professional job because I found that I wanted to turn my passion for programming into a career. Since then, I have been learning continuously and aiming to get my first job as a **Junior Java Developer**. Privately, I am a husband, a happy owner of two wonderful Maine Coons and an active stoma advocate. I try to show people that despite having a stoma, one can train krav maga or BJJ, hike or swim and be a confident, happy and healthy person. I invite you to get to know me better whether by reviewing materials with my participation as well as giving me a chance to meet in person during an interview. I hope to see you soon!
